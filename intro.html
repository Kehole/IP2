            <p class="intro-body">this is a photo-and-text journey told in three parts. It follows a ghost who wakes up in the desert with no clear past, only a pull toward the ocean. From the desert begins with heat, distance, and a body that isn't really thereâjust movement, thirst, and strange calm.</p>

            <p class="intro-body">Through the city shifts into noise, color, signs, and people's traces: murals, courts, alleys, and sharp corners that make the ghost feel both closer to life and further from it. To the sea is the ending and the release: the coastline appears, the air changes, and the ghost finally reaches what has been calling him the whole time.</p>
