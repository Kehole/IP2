## Version Management Guide

GitHub automatically tracks every change you make. Here's how to use it:

### View All Past Versions
1. Go to your repo: https://github.com/Kehole/IP2
2. Click the **"History"** button (top right, next to the commit hash)
3. You'll see a list of every change ever made, with dates and descriptions

### View a Specific File's History
1. Click on any file (e.g. `city.html`)
2. Click the **"History"** button in the top right
3. You'll see every version of that specific file

### Go Back to a Previous Version of a File
1. Open the file's history (steps above)
2. Click the commit you want to go back to
3. Click the **"..."** menu > **"View file"** to see the old version
4. Copy the code, or click **"Raw"** to get the plain text

### Compare Changes Between Versions
1. In the commit history, click any commit
2. You'll see a **green/red diff** showing exactly what changed
3. Green = added lines, Red = removed lines

### Restore an Old Version
If you want to undo a change and go back:
1. Find the old version of the file in History
2. Click the commit > View the file
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Select all and replace with the old code
5. Commit the change with a message like "Revert to previous version"

### Tips
- **Always write clear commit messages** when you make changes (e.g. "Update navigation links" instead of "Update")
- **Each commit is a snapshot** - you can always go back to any of them
- **Nothing is ever truly lost** on GitHub - even deleted code lives in the history
